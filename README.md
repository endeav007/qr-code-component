## Overview

## My process

I started by looking at the desktop and mobile designs, and noting any differences/similarites between each. Then, in HTML, I structured all of the elements I needed and sorted them into classes. After that, I focused on general stylying, and getting the content in the right positions, before I did more detailed work with colors. 


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 

### What I learned

This was a good review of styling in CSS for me. Espcially the skill of using dynamic units for styling. I tried to focus on utilizing 'em' and percentages over pixels for this project.

```css
.container{
    
    margin: auto;
    margin-top: 15%;
    padding: 1em;
    background-color: white;
    width: 15em;
    border-radius: 10px;
   
}
```

I haven't used a lot of media queries before in my CSS projects before, and I'm sure it'll become a helpful skill for the future.
```css
@media(min-width:700px){

}
```




### Continued development

Though I've finalized this project, I want to focus on making more mobile apps in the future, since that's something I want to improve at.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_responsive.asp) - This resource helped me learn how to make responsive web pages. I hadn't used media queries before this project, and this resource was helpful for me to leearn.
